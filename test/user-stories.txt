A composer's sketching program intended to encourage the use of the entire chord space (of all possible chords).
----------
HOW TO PROCEED: AN EXPLORATION
Code invariants-tests in the code classes, if useful.
Extend a composition by one chord.
Not use CRC (Class (name), Responsibilities, (class) Collaborators) cards. 
Perhaps write unit tests to refactor my (already at the start) existing code?
Save and edit compositions.
Use Jim Menard's pure-Ruby library, 'midilib'.

----------
GLOSSARY
Bass note name. Example: 'A'.
Chord octave-note distributions ('convert bit pattern into chord system name').
Mozart chord name. Example: [Find in my Mozart chords blog post.]
Note-plus regular chord name. Example: 'Am'.
Tonic regular chord name. Example: 'i7'.
Rhythm indicators. Example: '|- -(- -)|' is a measure of time equally subdivided into three units.
(Some kind of) standard jazz chord name. Example: [suspensions or minor sevenths, etc.].
Tool. Unix tool program.

USER STORIES MET BY PROGRAMMER TASKS, BELOW
A program to translate a stream of note-plus regular chord names, melody note names, and rhythm indicators into MIDI.

A program to translate MIDI into a stream of note-plus regular chord names and rhythm indicators, i.e., a lead sheet.

----------
USER STORIES NOT TO DO
A program to translate a stream of note-plus regular chord names and rhythm indicators into standard musical notation (e.g., quarter notes) using (possibly) Gnu music writer notation.

----------
USER STORIES
A program to compose music by entering rests, bass note names, melody note names, note-plus regular chord names, and rhythm indicators.

At any chord, the user should be able to change the tempo and/or the volume of the composition.

The user should be able to see chord suggestions based on unity of bass note or of melody note, or chordal unity with N chord notes being the same, N going from zero up to all the chord notes, with a breakdown by number of notes in such chords.

----------
USER STORIES, COPYING
The user should be able to copy and overlay sections from the notes of the composition onto other sections already containing the desired rhythm indicators.

The user should be able to copy sections of the composition while leaving the notes and chords null, possibly just bass notes of 'A' with nothing else.

The user should be able to insert, delete, copy, and transpose sections of the composition.

Any form of copying possible from a section of the composition should be possible similarly from another composition.
