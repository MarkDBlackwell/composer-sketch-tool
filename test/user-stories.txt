A composer's sketching program intended to encourage the use of the entire chord space (of all possible chords).
----------
HOW TO PROCEED: AN EXPLORATION
Code invariants-tests in the code classes, if useful.
Extend a composition by one chord.
Not use CRC (Class (name), Responsibilities, (class) Collaborators) cards. 
Perhaps write unit tests to refactor my (already at the start) existing code?
Save and edit compositions.
Use Jim Menard's pure-Ruby library, 'midilib'.

----------
NEW THOUGHTS
At any chord, change the octavity; store the octavity at the beginning of the composition and wherever it is altered.
For each available octavity, build and read fixed tables.
In non-duodecimal octavities, the tonic regular chord names are simply chord numbers, and the bass and melody note names are simply (in-octave) note numbers. Even in the duodecimal octavity, in compositions, store (in-octave) note numbers and chord numbers, not bass or melody note names or tonic regular chord names.
Tools are needed to translate between, on the one hand, regular, Mozart, and jazz tonic chord names, and on the other hand, chord numbers; similarly for note names and numbers.

----------
GLOSSARY
Bass or melody note name. Example: 'A'.
Chord octave-note distributions ('convert bit pattern into chord system name').
Mozart chord name. Example: [Find in my Mozart chords blog post.]
Necklace. A chord, regardless of its transposition and/or inversion; see Wikipedia.
Note-plus regular chord name. Example: 'Am'.
Octavity. The number of equal-tempered notes within a doubling of the frequency. The leading global, or Western European, system is duodecimal (with 12). A simplification in the program is that all the musical notes it produces are equal-tempered.
Rhythm indicators. Example: '|- -(- -)|' is a measure of time equally subdivided into three units.
(Some kind of) standard jazz chord name. Example: [suspensions or minor sevenths, etc.].
Tonic regular chord name. Example: 'i7'.
Tool. Unix tool program.

USER STORIES MET BY PROGRAMMER TASKS, BELOW
A program to translate a stream of note-plus regular chord names, melody note names, and rhythm indicators into MIDI.

A program to translate MIDI into a stream of note-plus regular chord names and rhythm indicators, i.e., a lead sheet.

----------
USER STORIES NOT TO DO
A program to translate a stream of note-plus regular chord names and rhythm indicators into standard musical notation (e.g., quarter notes) using (possibly) Gnu music writer notation.

----------
USER STORIES
A program to compose music by entering melody note names, bass note names, tonic regular chord names, rests, and rhythm indicators.

At any chord, the user should be able to change the volume, the tempo, and/or the octavity of the composition.

To aid in producing unity in the composition, the user should be enabled to receive chord suggestions containing any desired number of notes, based on the sameness of the bass note, of the melody note, and/or of the necklace, and/or based on the sameness (or equal transposition) of any N of the chord notes, N ranging from zero to the entire chord.

The user shall not need the text files of compositions to be intelligible, for instance, for direct editing.

----------
USER STORIES, COPYING
Any form of copying possible, from another section of the composition, should similarly be possible from another composition.

The user should be able to copy and overlay sections from the notes of the composition onto other sections already containing the desired rhythm indicators.

The user should be able to copy sections of the composition while leaving the notes and chords empty, possibly just bass notes of 'A' with nothing else.

The user should be able to insert, delete, copy, and transpose sections of the composition.
