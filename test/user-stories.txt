HOW TO PROCEED: AN EXPLORATION
Not use CRC (Class (name), Responsibilities, (class) Collaborators) cards. 
Code invariants-tests in the code classes, if useful.
Extend a composition by one chord.
Save and edit compositions.
In the rhythm scheme, '|- -(- -)|' is a measure of time equally subdivided into three units.
Perhaps write unit tests to refactor my (already at the start) existing code?
