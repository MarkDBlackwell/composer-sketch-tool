1: {A program to} compose (sketch) music by entering melody note names, bass note names, regular tonic chord names, rests, and rhythm indicators.

2:2 {{{{A program to} translate} a stream of} rhythm indicators and regular note-plus chord names} and melody note names, etc. into MIDI so it can be played by a typical computer sound card.

3:3 {{{{A program to} translate} a stream of} rhythm indicators and regular note-plus chord names} into standard musical notation (e.g., quarter notes) using (possibly) Gnu music writer notation.

1:2 {{A program to} translate} MIDI into a stream of rhythm indicators and regular note-plus chord names, i.e., a lead sheet.

: {Copying}: Any possible form of copying from another section of the composition, shall similarly be possible from another composition.

: {{Copying}: {{The user shall} be able to} copy} and overlay sections from the notes of the composition onto other sections already containing the desired rhythm indicators.

: {{Copying}: {{The user shall} be able to} copy} sections of the composition while leaving the notes and chords empty, possibly just bass notes of 'G' ('0') with nothing else.

: {{Copying}: {{The user shall} be able to} copy}, insert, delete, and transpose sections of the composition.

: {{The user shall} be able to} extend a composition by one chord.

: {{The user shall} be able to} name chords and necklaces. Names stored in the composition and in a user configuration file.

: {{The user shall} be able to} receive (for purposes of increasing unity in the composition) chord suggestions containing the same number of notes, based on sameness of the necklace, or containing any desired number of notes based on sameness of the bass note, sameness of the melody note, and/or sameness (or equal transposition) of any N of the chord notes, N ranging from zero to one note less than the entire chord.

: {{The user shall} be able to} save and edit compositions.

: {{{The user shall} be able to}, at any chord, change the} octavity; store the octavity at the beginning of the composition and wherever it is altered.

: {{{The user shall} be able to}, at any chord, change the} volume, the tempo, the key (for relative chord printouts), and/or the octavity of the composition onward.

: {The user shall} not need intelligible composition text files: for instance, for direct editing of chord names. However, the user shall be enabled to print out compositions containing, at the user's choice, intelligible absolute or relative chord names.
