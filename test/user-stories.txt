----------
HOW TO PROCEED: AN EXPLORATION
o Code invariants-tests in the code classes, if useful.
o Extend a composition by one chord.
o Limitation: 16 channels bent independently limits the size of chords in large octavities.
o Not use CRC (Class (name), Responsibilities, (class) Collaborators) cards. 
o Perhaps write unit tests to refactor my (already at the start) existing code?
o Save and edit compositions.
o Use Jim Menard's pure-Ruby library, 'midilib'.
o What to do about octavity, etc. being kinds of 'rhythm' indicators?
----------
NEW THOUGHTS
o At any chord, change the octavity; store the octavity at the beginning of the composition and wherever it is altered.
o For each available octavity, build and read fixed tables.
o In non-duodecimal octavities, the regular tonic chord names are simply chord numbers, and the bass and melody note names are simply (in-octave) note numbers. Even in the duodecimal octavity, in compositions, store (in-octave) note numbers and chord numbers, not bass or melody note names or regular tonic chord names.
o Tools are needed to translate between, on the one hand, regular, Mozart, and jazz tonic chord names, and on the other hand, chord numbers; similarly for note names and numbers.
----------
USER STORIES NOT TO DO
o A program to translate a stream of regular note-plus chord names and rhythm indicators into standard musical notation (e.g., quarter notes) using (possibly) Gnu music writer notation.
----------
USER STORIES MET BY PROGRAMMER TASKS, BELOW
o A program to translate a stream of regular note-plus chord names, melody note names, and rhythm indicators, etc. into MIDI so it can be played by a typical computer sound card.
o A program to translate MIDI into a stream of regular note-plus chord names and rhythm indicators, i.e., a lead sheet.
----------
USER STORIES
o A program to compose (sketch) music by entering melody note names, bass note names, regular tonic chord names, rests, and rhythm indicators.
o At any chord, the user should be able to change the volume, the tempo, the key (for relative chord printouts), and/or the octavity of the composition onward.
o The user shall not need intelligible composition text files: for instance, for direct editing of chord names. However, the user shall be enabled to print out compositions containing, at the user's choice, intelligible absolute or relative chord names.
o To aid in producing unity in the composition, the user should be enabled to receive chord suggestions containing the same number of notes, based on sameness of the necklace, or containing any desired number of notes based on sameness of the bass note, sameness of the melody note, and/or sameness (or equal transposition) of any N of the chord notes, N ranging from zero to one note less than the entire chord.
----------
USER STORIES, COPYING
o Any possible form of copying from another section of the composition, shall similarly be possible from another composition.
o The user should be able to copy and overlay sections from the notes of the composition onto other sections already containing the desired rhythm indicators.
o The user should be able to copy sections of the composition while leaving the notes and chords empty, possibly just bass notes of 'G' ('0') with nothing else.
o The user should be able to insert, delete, copy, and transpose sections of the composition.

GLOSSARY
Absolute chord name. Example: 'A7'.
Bass or melody note name. They run from 'G' down to 'Ab'. For duodecimal octavity only.
Bass or melody note number. In duodecimal octavity, they run from '0' down to '11'. A simplification in this package is that the note number, '0', for all octavities, has the same pitch: a note, G on a standard, physical piano.
Chord number. Example: '0'. In duodecimal octavity, they run from '0' to '2047', which is the number formed by the mathematical expression, '2**11 - 1'. 
Chord octave-note distributions ('convert bit pattern into chord system name'). In duodecimal octavity, they run from '0' to '7ff': the bass note is implicit.
Duodecimal. Having to do with the number, twelve ('12').
Key modulation(?). A 'rhythm' indicator.
Mozart note-plus chord name. Example: [-s4. /3. Find in my Mozart chords blog post.] For duodecimal octavity only.
Mozart tonic chord name. See, 'Mozart note-plus chord name' and 'Regular tonic chord name'.
Necklace. A chord, regardless of transpositions and inversions. See the Wikipedia article of the same name.
Necklace inversion number. In duodecimal octavity, they run through some of '0' to '11': i.e., whatever notes the chord has.
Necklace number. In duodecimal octavity, they run from '0' to '350'.
Octavity. The number of equal-tempered notes within a doubling of the frequency. A rhythm indicator. The major, globally used, Western European system has duodecimal octavity (wherein this number is, '12'). A simplification in this package is that all the musical notes produced are equal-tempered.
Regular note-plus chord name. Example: 'Am'. For duodecimal octavity only.
Regular tonic chord name. Example: 'i7'. For duodecimal octavity only.
Relative chord name. Example: 'II7'.
Rest. A 'rhythm' indicator. Literally, 'rest'.
Rhythm indicators. Example: '|- -(- -)|' is eight (8) indicators specifying a measure of time equally subdivided into three units. Includes key modulations(?), octavities, rests, tempos, and volumes.
Standard jazz note-plus chord name (of some kind). Example: [suspensions or minor sevenths, etc.]. For duodecimal octavity only.
Standard jazz tonic chord name. See, 'Standard jazz note-plus chord name (of some kind)' and 'Regular tonic chord name'.
Tempo. A 'rhythm' indicator.
Tool. Unix tool program.
Volume. A 'rhythm' indicator.
