all2mid - bass note numbers, melody note numbers, chord octave-note distributions, rhythm indicators, volumes, tempos, rests, and octavities into MIDI.

bc2ncm - bass note numbers and chord numbers into regular note-plus chord names.  At this point, it is unknown whether input of names is simpler.
