o 63 Program 2:1 There shall be a program, a Unix-like tool, to extract, from MIDI, a stream of (intermediate-layer) events: ('mid2mev').

Notes:
o On ticks:
oo One beat typically has 480 (= 32 * 15) ticks.
oo Starting the first measure, after tick 0, implies a rest.
oo Tick = clock tick, or pulse, number.
oo Ticks ascend indefinitely.

The lines of tokens (which must be in nondescending order by tick) are:

tick  'bar'                       (Need at the file's end, also.)
tick  'meter'  ticks_per_measure  (Defaults to 480 * 4 = 1920, which is '4/4'. A pickup measure needs a smaller number.)
tick  'off'    pitch
tick  'on'     pitch
tick  'tempo'  ticks_per_second   (Defaults to 480, which is metronome '60': one beat per second.)
tick  'volume' volume_number
