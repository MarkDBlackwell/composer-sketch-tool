o Application tests, like FXRuby examples for users to try.
o Code (LTCR): (non-test class) coding.
o CRC: (Class (name), Responsibilities, (class) Collaborators) cards; for each user story, use them to design an implementation.
o Extreme Programming (XP) à la Kent Beck: learn it by following.
o How to implement: jump right into coding.
o Invariant-tests: if useful, write in the code classes.
o Listen (LTCR): listen to the users.
o LTCR: Listen, Test, Code, Reshape.
o Preexisting code (at the start): perhaps write unit tests to refactor it?
o Reshape (LTCR): called also refactor, and (re)design.
o Scorewriter by Cakewalk used for MIDI file work.
o Test (-first, LTCR): first write tests, with Rspec.
o Up-front design: do for user-perceptible things & prototyping.
o User stories (solution). Two kinds of minds, generally shocked by each other, user and developer, can use them to communicate.

o User stories are arranged thus in a file (descendingly sorted). Right braces are used after multiply-used beginnings within each named heading (e.g., 'Chord name'), except for punctuation, the article, 'a' (because it looks like a list element), and the verb infinitive indicator word, 'to' (so as not to split it). Good to rephrase to maximize the length of the beginnings in common:
ff USER STORIES (WITH RISK:PRIORITY)
f7 Chord name------------------------------
f7 Chord name 3:3 User's [...].
ef Copy------------------------------
ef Copy 2:3 The user shall} be able to} [...].
ef Copy 1:2 Any [...].

o User story cards. Risk and priority numbers are written upon them. From http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremePlanning. Risk 4 and Priorities 4 and 5are new, from mdb:
oo RISK:
1. We know exactly how to do this.
2. We think we know how to do this.
3. We have no idea what this means or how to do this.
4. This is fully encompassed by more precise user stories.
oo PRIORITY:
1. These have to be done if the system is to meet its business goals.
2. These have a measurable impact on the system's business goals.
3. These would make the user happy, but without explicit justification.
4. These merely generalize other user stories.
5. These are background information or definitional.
