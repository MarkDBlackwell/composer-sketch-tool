PROCESS/DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES
o Code invariant-tests in the code classes, if useful.
o Extreme Programming (XP) a la Kent Beck.
o For user-perceptible things, prototyping: do up-front design. For how to implement: jump right into code.
o From http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremePlanning :
oo Priority:
  1. These have to be done if the system is to meet its business goals.
  2. These have a measurable impact on the system's business goals.
  3. These would make the user happy, but without explicit justification.
oo Risk:
  1. We know exactly how to do this.
  2. We think we know how to do this.
  3. We have no idea what this means or how to do this.
o Listen, Test, Code, Reshape (LTCR).
o Perhaps write unit tests to refactor my (already at the start) existing code?
o Reshape is refactor & redesign.
o Test is Test-first: first write tests, using Rspec.
o Two kinds of minds: user and developer: shocked by each other. User stories is a solution to inspire them to communicate.
o Use CRC (Class (name), Responsibilities, (class) Collaborators) cards to make a design to implement each user story.
